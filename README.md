🚦 Project Overview

The Smart Traffic Signal Model uses real-time traffic density detection to automatically control signal timings.

Instead of a traditional fixed-timer system, this model analyzes vehicle load on each lane and adjusts the green signal duration accordingly.

This improves:

Traffic flow efficiency

Emergency response time

Fuel conservation

Road safety

🎯 Project Objectives

Detect traffic density using sensors/deep learning.

Automatically adjust signal duration based on real-time traffic.

Reduce unnecessary waiting time at empty lanes.

Implement a scalable model for smart cities.

🧠 How the System Works

The system works through four major steps:

1️⃣ Data Collection

Traffic images or sensor readings are taken from all lanes.

2️⃣ Traffic Density Detection

AI/ML or simple image processing techniques (e.g., pixel thresholding or object detection) are used to determine the number of vehicles.

3️⃣ Priority Calculation

The lane with the highest vehicle count is given maximum green signal time.

4️⃣ Automatic Signal Switching

The signal cycles through all lanes, adjusting timing dynamically.
